# Testing OmniAuth

This is just a little sample Rails 3.2 application that includes [OmniAuth][] and has integration tests (using [RSpec][] and [Capybara][]).

Nothing magical here.  Simply followed the instructions in the [OmniAuth Integration Testing wiki page][wiki].

Here's my spec: [omniauth_login_spec.rb](https://github.com/remi/testing-omniauth/blob/master/spec/acceptance/omniauth_login_spec.rb)

[OmniAuth]: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth
[RSpec]:    http://rspec.info
[Capybara]: https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara
